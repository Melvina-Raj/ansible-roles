This simple role installs Ansible on the targeted hosts as well as some other customizations.

The example [playbook.yml](playbook.yml) shows how to use this role in a playbook. The `run.sh` script can be used as follows:
* Login to Azure Cloud Shell
* Clone this repository
* Execute `./run.sh`. 

This creates an Azure VM and converts it to an Ansible controller.
